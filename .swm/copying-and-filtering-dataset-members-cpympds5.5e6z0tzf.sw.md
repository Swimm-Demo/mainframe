title: Copying and Filtering Dataset Members (CPYMPDS5)
---
The CPYMPDS5 job is used for copying members from one Partitioned Data Set (PDS) to another while excluding specified members. This is achieved using the IEBCOPY utility, which performs the copy operation and ensures that the specified members are omitted from the output dataset. The input dataset and output dataset are defined, and the members to be excluded are listed in the job.

For example, if the input dataset contains members MEMBER1, MEMBER2, and MEMBER3, and MEMBER1 and MEMBER3 are specified for exclusion, only MEMBER2 will be copied to the output dataset.
