title: Copying first 10 records (CP10FSTR)
---
The CP10FSTR job is used to copy the first 10 records from a specified input dataset to an output dataset using the ICETOOL utility. This process is useful for creating a sample or verifying the contents of the dataset. The job involves executing the `JSTEP020` step, which handles the copying operation.

For example, if the input dataset contains transaction records, the CP10FSTR job can be used to extract the first 10 records for a quick review or validation.
