title: Scratching a Dataset (SCRTCHPS)
---
In our mainframe environment, managing datasets efficiently is essential. The SCRTCHPS job is designed to scratch (delete) a temporary dataset on the IBM OS/390 operating system. This process involves specifying the dataset by its name and volume, and then using the IEHPROGM utility to perform the deletion.

For example, if there is a temporary dataset named 'FERMYNO.TEST.PSDATA.TEMP' on volume 'OS39M1', this job will remove it.
