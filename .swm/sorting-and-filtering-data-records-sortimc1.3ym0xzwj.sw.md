title: Sorting and Filtering Data Records (SORTIMC1)
---
The SORTIMC1 job is used for sorting data records in ascending order based on the first 10 characters and filtering records that meet specific inclusion conditions. This process is essential for organizing and managing data efficiently within the system. The job takes an input dataset, applies the sorting and filtering criteria, and outputs the filtered records to a specified output dataset.

For example, if a record has '2020' in positions 25 to 28 or does not have 'F' in position 50, it will be included in the output dataset.
