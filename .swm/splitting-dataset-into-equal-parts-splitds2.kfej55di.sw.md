title: Splitting dataset into equal parts (SPLITDS2)
---
This document describes the SPLITDS2 job, which is responsible for splitting a dataset into two equal parts for efficient data management. The job reads the input dataset and alternately distributes its records into two output datasets, ensuring balanced data distribution.

For example, if the input dataset contains lines 1, 2, and 3, line 1 will go to the first output dataset, line 2 to the second output dataset, and line 3 back to the first output dataset.
