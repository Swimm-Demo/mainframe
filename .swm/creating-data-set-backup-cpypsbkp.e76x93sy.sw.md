title: Creating Data Set Backup (CPYPSBKP)
---
The CPYPSBKP job is responsible for creating a backup of a test dataset to ensure data integrity and availability. This is achieved by using the IEBGENER utility program to copy data from the original test dataset to a new backup dataset. The input for this process is the original test dataset, and the output is the newly created backup dataset.

For example, the job copies data from 'FERMYNO.TEST.PSIN' to 'FERMYNO.TEST.PSIN.BACKUP'.
