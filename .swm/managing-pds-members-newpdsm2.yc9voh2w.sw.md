title: Managing PDS Members (NEWPDSM2)
---
This document describes the process of managing PDS members using the NEWPDSM2 job. The job involves creating members in PDS datasets and copying data into these members. The flow is achieved through two steps, STEP001 and STEP002, which utilize the IEBGENER utility program to perform the data copying operations.

For instance, in STEP001, data is copied into the member MEMBER1 of the dataset FERMYNO.TEST.PDS2, and similarly, in STEP002, data is copied into the member MEMBER1 of the dataset FERMYNO.TEST.PDS3.
