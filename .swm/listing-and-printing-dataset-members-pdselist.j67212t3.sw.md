title: Listing and Printing Dataset Members (PDSELIST)
---
The PDSELIST job is used for listing and printing the contents of all members of a PDS or PDSE dataset. This is achieved using the IEBPTPCH utility, which processes the dataset and outputs the member contents to SYSOUT. The job ID for this process is PDSELIST.

For example, if the dataset `FERMYNO.TEST.PDS1` contains multiple members, the PDSELIST job will list and print the contents of each member to the system output.
