title: Sorting and Removing Duplicate Records (SORTST01)
---
The SORTST01 job is responsible for sorting data from an input dataset and removing any duplicate records. This is achieved by reading the input data, sorting it based on specified fields, and then outputting the sorted and unique records to the system output. The job specifically targets the identification numbers located in records 1-3, ensuring that only unique entries are retained.

For example, if the input dataset contains multiple entries with the same identification number, the SORTST01 job will sort these entries and remove any duplicates, outputting only one unique entry per identification number.
