title: Preparing and organizing data (SORTCP01)
---
The SORTCP01 job is responsible for preparing and organizing data for further processing. It achieves this by reading an input dataset, sorting the data, and then copying the sorted data into three separate output datasets. This process ensures that the data is properly structured and ready for subsequent operations.

For instance, if the input dataset contains unsorted transaction records, the SORTCP01 job will sort these records and distribute them into three different output datasets for further analysis or processing.

## Preparing and organizing data for further processing

This section is about sorting and copying input data into multiple output datasets for further processing. The program reads the input dataset, sorts the data, and then copies the sorted data into three separate output datasets.
