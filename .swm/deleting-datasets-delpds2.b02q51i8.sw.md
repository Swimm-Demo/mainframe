title: Deleting Datasets (DELPDS2)
---
The DELPDS2 job is responsible for deleting two partitioned datasets (PDS) and their members. This is achieved by executing the IEFBR14 utility program in two steps: STEP001 and STEP002. The input to this flow is the dataset names, and the output is the deletion of these datasets along with their members.

For example, the job deletes the datasets `FERMYNO.TEST.PDS2` and `FERMYNO.TEST.PDS3`.
