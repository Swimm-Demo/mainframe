title: Creating a new PS dataset (NEWPS1)
---
In our mainframe environment, creating datasets is a common task. This document describes the job NEWPS1, which is responsible for creating a new physical sequential dataset. The job uses the IEFBR14 utility program to specify the dataset name, disposition, space allocation, and data control block parameters.

For example, the job creates a dataset named FERMYNO.TEST.PS1 with specific space and data control block parameters.
