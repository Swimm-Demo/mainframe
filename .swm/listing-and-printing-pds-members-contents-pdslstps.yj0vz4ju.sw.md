title: Listing and Printing PDS Members Contents (PDSLSTPS)
---
The PDSLSTPS job is used for listing and printing the contents of all members from a Partitioned Data Set (PDS) or Partitioned Data Set Extended (PDSE) dataset. This is achieved by utilizing the IEBPTPCH utility to copy the contents from the source dataset DSN810.SDSNSAMP to the target dataset FERMYNO.DSFILES.DSN810.SDSNSAMP.

For example, if the source dataset contains multiple members with various data, the PDSLSTPS job will print and transfer all these members' contents to the specified target dataset.
