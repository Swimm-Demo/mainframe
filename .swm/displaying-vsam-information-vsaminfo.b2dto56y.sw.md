title: Displaying VSAM Information (VSAMINFO)
---
The VSAMINFO job is used to display information for a specific VSAM dataset. This is achieved by using the IDCAMS utility to list the catalog entry for the VSAM dataset and output the information to SYSOUT. The job includes a single step, `STEP001`, which executes the IDCAMS program to retrieve and display the VSAM information.

For example, if the VSAM dataset entry is `FERMYNO.VSAM.ESDS`, the job will list all the catalog information related to this dataset and display it in the system output.
