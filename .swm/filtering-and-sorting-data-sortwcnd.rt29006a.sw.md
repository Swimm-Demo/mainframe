title: Filtering and Sorting Data (SORTWCND)
---
The SORTWCND job filters records from an input dataset where a specific field is not numeric and then sorts the filtered data into an output dataset. This process is essential for ensuring that only relevant data is included in the output, which can then be used for further processing or analysis.

For example, if the input dataset contains records with both numeric and non-numeric values in a specific field, the SORTWCND job will exclude the numeric records and include only the non-numeric ones in the output dataset.
