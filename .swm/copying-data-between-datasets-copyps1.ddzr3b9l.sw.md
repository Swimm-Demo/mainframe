title: Copying Data Between Datasets (COPYPS1)
---
This document describes the COPYPS1 job, which is responsible for copying data from one dataset to another using the SORT program. The job reads the source dataset and copies its contents to the destination dataset, overwriting any existing data in the destination.

For example, if the source dataset contains test data, this job will copy that data to the destination dataset, ensuring that the destination dataset is updated with the latest test data.
