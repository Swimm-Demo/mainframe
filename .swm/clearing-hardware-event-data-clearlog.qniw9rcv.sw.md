title: Clearing Hardware Event Data (CLEARLOG)
---
The CLEARLOG job is responsible for clearing and initializing the hardware event recorder dataset. This job ensures that the SYS1.LOGREC dataset is properly maintained and managed by clearing its contents. The process involves executing the `IFCDIP00` program to clear the dataset, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and performance of the system.

For example, when the system logs hardware events, the SYS1.LOGREC dataset can become cluttered over time. Running the CLEARLOG job will clear this dataset, ensuring that new events can be recorded without issues.
