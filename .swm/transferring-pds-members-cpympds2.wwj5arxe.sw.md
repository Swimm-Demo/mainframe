title: Transferring PDS members (CPYMPDS2)
---
This document describes the CPYMPDS2 job, which is responsible for transferring all members from one Partitioned Data Set (PDS) to another. The process is achieved by specifying the input and output datasets and utilizing a dummy SYSIN to facilitate the transfer. The job uses the IEBCOPY utility to perform the copy operation.

For example, if the input dataset is `FERMYNO.TEST.PDS1` and the output dataset is `FERMYNO.TEST.PDS2`, the job will copy all members from `PDS1` to `PDS2`.
