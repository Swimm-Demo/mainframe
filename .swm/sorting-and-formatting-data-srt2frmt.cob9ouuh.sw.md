title: Sorting and Formatting Data (SRT2FRMT)
---
The SRT2FRMT job is responsible for sorting and formatting data records from an input dataset and storing the organized data into an output dataset. This process is achieved by using the SORT utility with specific formatting and field parameters. The job reads the input data, sorts it based on the defined fields, and writes the sorted data to the output dataset.

For instance, if the input dataset contains unsorted records, the SRT2FRMT job will sort these records based on the specified fields and format, resulting in an organized output dataset.
