title: Copying PDS Members (CPYMPDS3)
---
This document describes the CPYMPDS3 job, which is responsible for copying specific members from one partitioned data set (PDS) to another. The job achieves this by defining the input and output datasets and specifying the members to be copied. The input dataset is identified as `FERMYNO.TEST.PDS1`, and the output dataset is `FERMYNO.TEST.PDS2`. The members to be copied are explicitly listed in the job.

For example, if the job specifies `MEMBER1` and `MEMBER3` to be copied, these members will be transferred from the input PDS to the output PDS.
