title: Merging PDS Members (CPYMPDS4)
---
The CPYMPDS4 job is responsible for merging specified members from two input Partitioned Data Sets (PDS) into a single output PDS. This is achieved using the IEBCOPY utility, which copies the specified members from the input datasets to the output dataset. The input datasets are defined as DD1 and DD2, and the output dataset is defined as DD3.

For example, if the input datasets contain members MEMBER1, MEMBER2, MEMBER3, and MEMBER4, the job will copy MEMBER3 and MEMBER4 from DD1 and MEMBER1 and MEMBER2 from DD2 into DD3.
