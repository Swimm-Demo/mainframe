title: Creating PDS Datasets (NEWPDS2)
---
This document describes the flow of creating two new PDS datasets for management and manipulation. The NEWPDS2 job uses the IEFBR14 utility to define the datasets FERMYNO.TEST.PDS1 and FERMYNO.TEST.PDS2 with specific attributes for space, record format, and organization.

For example, the job specifies the space allocation in cylinders and the record format as fixed block for both datasets.

## Creating PDS Datasets for Management and Manipulation

Steps in this section: `STEP001`, `STEP002`.

This section is about creating two new PDS datasets on the mainframe. The program uses the IEFBR14 utility to define the datasets FERMYNO.TEST.PDS1 and FERMYNO.TEST.PDS2 with specific attributes for space, record format, and organization.
