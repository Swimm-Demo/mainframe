title: Creating new PS datasets (NEWPS2)
---
This document describes the process of creating two new PS datasets using the NEWPS2 job. The job utilizes the IEFBR14 utility program to define and allocate these datasets. These datasets are intended for comparison tasks and input/output operations in subsequent processes.

For instance, the job creates datasets `FERMYNO.TEST.PS1` and `FERMYNO.TEST.PS2` with specific attributes such as space allocation and data control block settings.
