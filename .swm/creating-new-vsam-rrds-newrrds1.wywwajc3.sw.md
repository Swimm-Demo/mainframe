title: Creating new VSAM RRDS (NEWRRDS1)
---
In our system, creating a new VSAM RRDS dataset is essential for managing and organizing data efficiently. The NEWRRDS1 job is responsible for this task. It defines the structure and allocation of the dataset on a specific disk volume. The input for this job includes parameters such as the dataset name, record size, and volume information, while the output is the creation of the VSAM RRDS dataset.

For example, the job defines a cluster with the name 'FERMYNO.VSAM.RRDS01', specifying its record size and space allocation on the volume 'ZASYS1'.
