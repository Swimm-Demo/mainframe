title: Deleting PDS Members (DELPDSM2)
---
In our mainframe environment, managing Partitioned Data Sets (PDS) is essential for organizing and maintaining datasets. The DELPDSM2 job is designed to delete two specific members from a PDS. This is achieved by executing two steps, each utilizing the IDCAMS utility program to remove one member at a time.

For instance, if the PDS contains members named MEMBER1 and MEMBER2, this job will delete these members individually in two separate steps.

## Deleting members from PDS

Steps in this section: `STEP001`, `STEP002`.

This section is about removing two specific members from a Partitioned Data Set using the IDCAMS utility program. The program executes two steps to delete each member individually.
