title: Creating VSAM dataset (NEWESDS1)
---
In our system, creating a VSAM dataset is essential for managing and storing data efficiently. This document describes the NEWESDS1 job, which defines and creates a VSAM Entry-Sequenced Data Set (ESDS). The process involves specifying the dataset name, record size, free space, control interval size, and the disk volume where the dataset will be stored.

For example, the job defines a cluster with the name 'FERMYNO.VSAM.ESDS01', sets the record size to 200, and allocates space on the volume 'ZASYS1'.

## Creating VSAM dataset

Steps in this section: `STEP001`.

This section is about defining and creating a VSAM Entry-Sequenced Data Set (ESDS) using the IDCAMS utility program. It specifies the dataset name, record size, free space, control interval size, and the disk volume where the dataset will be stored.
