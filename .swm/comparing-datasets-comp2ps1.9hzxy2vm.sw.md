title: Comparing datasets (COMP2PS1)
---
This document describes the COMP2PS1 job, which is used to compare the contents of two datasets. The comparison is performed using the IEBCOMPR utility program, and the job returns a code indicating whether the datasets have the same content or different content.

For example, if the datasets FERMYNO.TEST.PS1 and FERMYNO.TEST.PS2 are compared, the job will return a code of 0 if their contents are the same, and a code of 8 if their contents are different.
