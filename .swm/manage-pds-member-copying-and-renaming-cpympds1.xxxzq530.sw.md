title: Manage PDS member copying and renaming (CPYMPDS1)
---
This document describes the CPYMPDS1 job, which manages the copying and renaming of members within partitioned datasets (PDS). The job uses the IEBCOPY utility to achieve this task. The input dataset and output dataset are specified, and a member from the input dataset is copied to the output dataset with a new name.

For example, the job copies the member 'MEMBER1' from 'FERMYNO.TEST.PDS1' to 'FERMYNO.TEST.PDS2' and renames it to 'MEMBER2'.
