---
The NEWPSWDT job is responsible for creating a new physical sequential (PS) dataset and populating it with test data for financial customer accounts. This dataset is used for testing purposes within the mainframe environment, ensuring that the data structure and content are suitable for subsequent processing and validation tasks. The job involves executing a program to generate the dataset and then inserting predefined test data into it.

For example, the job creates a dataset named `FERMYNO.TEST.PSDATA` and populates it with sample customer data, including fields such as ID, client name, document number, agency, account, type, signal, and balance.
