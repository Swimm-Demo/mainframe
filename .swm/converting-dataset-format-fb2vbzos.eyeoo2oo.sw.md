title: Converting dataset format (FB2VBZOS)
---
This document describes the FB2VBZOS job, which is responsible for converting a dataset from a fixed-block format to a variable-block format. The process is achieved by specifying the input dataset and creating an output dataset with the new format. The job uses the SORT program to perform the conversion.

For example, if the input dataset is 'FERMYNO.TEST.FB', the job will convert it to a variable-block format and store it as 'FERMYNO.TEST.VB'.
