title: Copying Records (CP50RECS)
---
The CP50RECS job is designed to copy the first 50 records from an input dataset to an output dataset using the SORT program. This job is part of our data processing tasks where we need to extract a subset of records for further analysis or processing. The input dataset is specified, and the output dataset is where the copied records will be stored.

For example, if the input dataset contains 1000 records, this job will copy only the first 50 records to the output dataset.
