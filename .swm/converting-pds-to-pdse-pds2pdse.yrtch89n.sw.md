title: Converting PDS to PDSE (PDS2PDSE)
---
This document describes the process of converting a Partitioned Data Set (PDS) to a Partitioned Data Set Extended (PDSE) using the PDS2PDSE job. The job involves copying data from an existing PDS dataset to a new PDSE dataset, with explicit space definitions for the new PDSE dataset. The input for this process is the original PDS dataset, and the output is the newly created PDSE dataset.

For example, the job takes `FERMYNO.TEST.PDS1` as the input PDS dataset and creates `FERMYNO.TEST.PDSE1` as the output PDSE dataset.

## Converting PDS to PDSE

Steps in this section: `STEP1`.

This section is about copying data from a PDS dataset to a new PDSE dataset, explicitly defining the space for the new PDSE dataset.
