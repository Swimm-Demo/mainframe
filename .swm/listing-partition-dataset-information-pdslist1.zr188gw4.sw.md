This document describes the PDSLIST1 job, which is used to generate a formatted listing of a specified partitioned dataset (PDS) and output the information to the system output. The job achieves this by executing the IEHLIST program, which processes the PDS and provides the necessary details. The input for this job is the name of the PDS, and the output is the detailed information about the PDS, displayed in the system output.

For example, if the PDS name is 'FERMYNO.TEST.PDS1', the job will list all the information related to this PDS and output it to the system output.
