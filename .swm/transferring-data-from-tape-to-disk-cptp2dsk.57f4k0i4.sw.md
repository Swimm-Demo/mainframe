title: Transferring Data from Tape to Disk (CPTP2DSK)
---
The CPTP2DSK job is responsible for copying data from a magnetic tape dataset to a partitioned dataset on disk. This process is achieved by utilizing the IEBCOPY utility, which facilitates the data transfer between the specified input and output datasets. The input for this job is the original dataset on the magnetic tape, and the output is the newly created dataset on the disk.

For instance, the job reads data from `FITA.DATASET.ORIGINAL` on the tape and writes it to `DASD.DATASET.DESTINO` on the disk.
