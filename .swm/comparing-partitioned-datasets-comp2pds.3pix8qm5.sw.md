title: Comparing Partitioned Datasets (COMP2PDS)
---
This document describes the COMP2PDS job, which is used to compare the contents of two partitioned datasets (PDS) to check for identical or different content. The job achieves this by executing the IEBCOMPR program, which performs the comparison and sets the return code based on the result.

For example, if the job compares `FERMYNO.TEST.PDS1` and `FERMYNO.TEST.PDS2`, it will output whether the datasets have the same content or not.
