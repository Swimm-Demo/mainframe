title: Creating KSDS (NEWKSDS1)
---
The document describes the NEWKSDS1 job, which is responsible for defining and creating a Key Sequenced Data Set (KSDS) for efficient data management. This process involves configuring specific parameters such as keys, record size, free space, tracks, control interval size, and disk volume. The input for this job includes the parameters for the KSDS, and the output is the creation of the KSDS on the specified disk volume.

For example, the job defines a KSDS with a key length of 5 bytes, a record size of 200 bytes, and allocates space for future expansions. The KSDS is created on the disk volume ZASYS1.

## Creating KSDS for efficient data management

Steps in this section: `STEP001`.

This section is about defining and creating a Key Sequenced Data Set (KSDS) using the IDCAMS utility. The KSDS is configured with specific parameters for keys, record size, free space, tracks, control interval size, and disk volume to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.
