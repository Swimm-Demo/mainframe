title: Converting variable-block dataset to fixed-block (VB2FB391)
---
This document describes the VB2FB391 job, which is responsible for converting a variable-block dataset to a fixed-block dataset. This conversion is achieved using the IEBGENER utility in an OS390 environment. The input for this job is a variable-block dataset, and the output is a newly created fixed-block dataset.

For example, if the input dataset is named 'FERMYNO.TEST.VB', the job will convert it to a fixed-block dataset named 'FERMYNO.TEST.FB'.
