title: Sorting and Filtering Records (SORTFIC1)
---
This document describes the SORTFIC1 job, which is responsible for sorting records from an input dataset and including only those records that meet specific character conditions in the output dataset. The job sorts the records in ascending order based on the first 10 characters and includes only those records where the characters in positions 20 to 21 are equal to 'NO'.

For example, if a record has 'NO' in positions 20 to 21, it will be included in the output dataset after being sorted.
