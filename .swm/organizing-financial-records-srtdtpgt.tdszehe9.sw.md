title: Organizing Financial Records (SRTDTPGT)
---
This document describes the process of organizing financial records by payment dates using the SRTDTPGT job. The job reads an input dataset, sorts the records based on the specified payment date field, and writes the sorted records to an output dataset. This ensures that the financial records are ordered chronologically by payment date, facilitating easier access and analysis.

For example, if the input dataset contains records with various payment dates, the job will sort these records so that the earliest payment dates appear first in the output dataset.
